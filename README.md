# RayCasterEngine
C# ray casting engine, pretty good actually.
it has input output, different classes using OOP. 
uses sfml to output to pixels but the logic of what pixel to draw where is done internally, no external library used
it casts rays and the rays bounce if they hit a ball, movement and rotations possible
for now there is a problem with the calculations of the ray angles, will fix.
